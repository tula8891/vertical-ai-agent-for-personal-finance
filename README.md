## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Demo_app
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Configure Streamlit theme (optional):
   Create or modify `.streamlit/config.toml`:

   primaryColor = "#4B8BBE"
   backgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"
   secondaryBackgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
   textColor = "#31333F"
   font = "sans serif"
   ```

## Development

### Available Commands
```bash
# Development
make setup         # Install dependencies and set up development environment
make run          # Run Streamlit application locally

# Code Quality
make format       # Format code with black and isort
make lint         # Run flake8 code quality checks
make pre-commit   # Run all pre-commit checks (format, lint, test)

# Testing
make test         # Run tests with HTML and XML reports
make test-coverage # Run tests with coverage report

# Release
make get-version  # Get next version number based on git tags
make release      # Create and push a new release (VERSION=x.y.z optional)

# Maintenance
make clean        # Clean up cache files and test reports

# Help
make help         # Show all available commands with descriptions
```

### Code Quality Tools
- **Black**: Code formatting (max line length: 130)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Code linting with plugins:
  - flake8-docstrings: Documentation checks
  - flake8-bugbear: Bug detection
  - flake8-comprehensions: List/Dict/Set comprehension checks
  - flake8-simplify: Code simplification suggestions
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **bandit**: Security linting
- **pre-commit**: Automated code quality checks

### Pre-commit Workflow
The pre-commit command runs the following checks in sequence:
1. Code formatting (black + isort)
2. Linting (flake8 with plugins)
3. Tests (pytest)
4. Coverage report generation
5. Pre-release validation (for releases)

### Release Process
The project follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

1. **Version Management**:
   - Versions are tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Current version: 1.6.8
   - Format: [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] (e.g., 1.6.8)

2. **Release Steps**:
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with new version and changes
   - Run `make pre-commit` to validate changes
   - Run `make release` to create a new version tag
   - Push changes and tags to repository

### Current Status (as of v1.6.8)
- Test Coverage: 49% (Target: 80%)
- All make commands functioning correctly
- Areas needing improvement:
  - Test coverage for signup_page.py (currently 5%)
  - Implementation of test files with 0% coverage
  - Database connection mocking for skipped tests
