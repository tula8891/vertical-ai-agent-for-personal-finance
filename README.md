## Sample Questions for users of EconoGenie

### 1. **How much should I save each month to achieve my financial goals?**

**Use Case**:
Determining how much to save each month to achieve your financial goals involves a few key steps. First, clearly define your financial goals, whether they are short-term, like saving for a vacation, or long-term, such as retirement or buying a house. Next, estimate the total cost of each goal and the timeframe in which you want to achieve them. For example, if you want to save for a vacation that costs $2,000 and you plan to go in a year, you'll need to save about $167 each month.

Once you have a clear picture of your goals, create a budget to understand your income and expenses. Identify areas where you can cut back to free up more money for savings. A common guideline is the 50/30/20 rule, which suggests allocating 50% of your income to necessities, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment. However, you can adjust these percentages based on your specific needs and goals.


### 2. **How do I pay off debt faster and minimize interest?**

**Use Case**:
Paying off debt faster and minimizing interest are crucial steps towards improving your financial health. To achieve this, start by understanding your debt. List all your debts, including the creditor, total amount owed, interest rate, and minimum payment. Prioritize your debts based on their interest rates, as those with higher rates are costing you the most money. Next, create a budget by tracking your income and expenses to identify areas where you can cut back and allocate extra money towards debt repayment.

One effective strategy is to pay more than the minimum required payment. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to pay off your debt and the total interest you pay. For example, if you have a $10,000 credit card debt with a 15% interest rate and a minimum payment of $200, paying an extra $100 each month can save you thousands in interest and shave years off your repayment time.


### 3. **Is the company targeting emerging markets for growth?**

**Use Case**:
To determine if a company is targeting emerging markets for growth, you should review its strategic plans, recent announcements, and financial reports. Look for mentions of expansion into regions like Asia, Africa, or Latin America, as well as investments in local infrastructure, partnerships, or product launches tailored to these markets. This information will indicate the company's focus on emerging markets for future growth.


### 4. **What are the risks that the company faces from industry competition?**

**Use Case**:
When evaluating the risks a company faces from industry competition, several key factors come into play. These include market share erosion, pricing pressure, innovation and technological advancements, customer loyalty and brand reputation, supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, talent attraction and retention, market saturation, mergers and acquisitions, and geographic expansion. To mitigate these risks, the company can adopt strategies such as continuous innovation, a customer-centric approach, strategic partnerships, cost management, brand building, talent management, regulatory compliance, and diversification. Investing in any company involves risks, and the impact of industry competition is just one of many factors to consider. Investors should carefully review the company's financial statements, annual reports, and other disclosures to understand the full range of risks and make informed investment decisions.


### 5. **How does the company plan to stay competitive in its industry over the next 3-5 years?**

**Use Case**:
For example, an investor may be interested in how a cloud computing company plans to stay ahead of AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud in the rapidly evolving industry. The company’s plans for future product launches, technological advancements, or market diversification could provide key insights.

## TruLens Bonus Prize:


We integrated TruLens with Snowflake and Cortex to evaluate search quality and performance. Our implementation focuses on measuring context relevance and search accuracy while managing computational costs.


**Key Features**:
- Snowflake-based vector operations for semantic search
- Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Automated quality assessment pipeline


**Limitations and Costs**:
1. Resource constraints:
  - Limited to 4 documents per query
  - Batch processing for large evaluations
  - Significant Snowflake compute costs


2. Performance overhead:
  - Added latency from instrumentation
  - Memory usage from metrics collection
  - Storage costs for evaluation data


3. Experimental scope:
  - Limited test queries due to cost
  - Selective instrumentation
  - Focus on critical use cases


See [TrueLens Documentation](docs/trulens_evaluation.md) for implementation details.
