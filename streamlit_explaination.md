This Streamlit application is a chatbot interface integrated with Snowflake Cortex, designed to provide a conversational AI experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. Here's a high-level overview of the key components and functionality:

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - **Login and Signup Pages**: The application starts with a login page where users can authenticate themselves. If they don't have an account, they can navigate to a signup page to create one.
   - **Session Management**: Once logged in, the user is redirected to the main chat interface. The session state is managed to keep track of whether the user is logged in and which page they should be viewing.

### 2. **Snowflake Integration**
   - **Session Initialization**: The application initializes a Snowflake session using credentials stored in Streamlit secrets. This session is used to interact with Snowflake's Cortex services.
   - **Cortex Search Services**: The application can query Snowflake Cortex Search Services to retrieve relevant documents or data chunks based on user queries. This is part of the RAG mechanism where the chatbot uses external data to generate responses.

### 3. **Chat Interface**
   - **Main Chat Page**: The main page features a chat interface where users can ask questions. The chatbot uses a selected model (like Mistral or Llama) to generate responses.
   - **Message History**: The chat history is maintained in the session state, allowing the chatbot to reference previous interactions if needed.
   - **Contextual Responses**: The chatbot uses the context retrieved from Snowflake Cortex to generate informed and relevant responses. It also has the capability to summarize chat history to provide more contextually aware answers.

### 4. **Advanced Options**
   - **Model Selection**: Users can select from different AI models available in the `MODELS` list.
   - **Context Chunks**: Users can specify the number of context chunks to retrieve from Snowflake Cortex.
   - **Debug Mode**: There's a debug mode that provides additional insights into the context documents and chat history summaries used by the chatbot.

### 5. **Custom Styling**
   - **CSS Styling**: The application uses custom CSS to provide a minimalist and professional look, enhancing the user experience.

### 6. **Logout Functionality**
   - **Logout Button**: Users can log out, which resets the session state and redirects them back to the login page.

### 7. **Error Handling and Debugging**
   - **Debug Mode**: The application includes a debug mode that can be toggled to display additional information, such as the context documents and chat history summaries, which can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding how the chatbot generates responses.

### 8. **RAG Mechanism**
   - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: The chatbot uses RAG to enhance its responses. It retrieves relevant documents or data chunks from Snowflake Cortex based on the user's query and uses this information to generate a more informed response.

### 9. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**
   - **Prompt Engineering**: The application dynamically constructs prompts for the AI model, incorporating the user's question, chat history, and retrieved context to generate coherent and relevant responses.

### 10. **Streamlit State Management**
   - **Session State**: The application uses Streamlit's session state to manage various aspects of the user's interaction, including login status, chat history, selected models, and debug settings.

### Summary
This application is a sophisticated chatbot that leverages Snowflake Cortex for data retrieval and advanced AI models for generating responses. It provides a seamless user experience with features like user authentication, chat history management, contextual response generation, and advanced configuration options. The integration with Snowflake allows the chatbot to access and utilize external data sources, making it a powerful tool for interactive and informed conversations.
